SERVER:
    OPTIMIZATIONS:
        - piratebaylocal searching (Via Helpers.matchPercent optimizations)

    IMPLEMENTATIONS:
        - kickasstorrents searching
        - piratebay searching
        - TorrentManager loading torrents from the state. Could implement own state saving or hook into session listeners and create torrent from the handle.
        - Torrent file viewing
        - Server sending updates to all clients when a torrent session update is pushed
        - Add command to set priorities
        - Add command to cancel download
        - Persistent messaging so rather than a download % putting a new line, it replaces the existing.

    FIXES:
        - Code formatting
        - matchPercent matching being unreliable (EG: search test and it comes up with non-sense)

    TESTS:
        - Using finished thing directly from jar
